# Requirement

Create a react project using any UI Library you’d like. Create 2 column layout website where the left column would be the sidebar and the right column for the content.
For the sidebar, please refer to the Figma file.
For the content, you will have to create 2 cards. The first card will get the total sales from the API endpoint provided. You will have to create a line chart where the time will be on the X axis and the sales.
For the second card, you will be provided with an API endpoint containing a list of users. Display them as provided. You will have to create a search bar that allows searching by name, city and date registered. When they search by city, the user should be able to search it by this format “@berlin”.
A profile page should also be provided with the data provided.
Make sure the web application’s UI you create pixel matches the one on Figma.

# Bonus Point
